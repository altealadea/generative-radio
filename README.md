# generative-radio

To use the generative radio you have to:

* Get a Freesound token from https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply and add it to config.js.
* Upload all files on a server or use a server solution stack (such as MAMP, LAMP or XAMPP).
* Change the content of piece.json to get different results.
